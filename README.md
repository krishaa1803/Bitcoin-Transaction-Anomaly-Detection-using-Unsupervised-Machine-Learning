# Bitcoin-Transaction-Anomaly-Detection-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Built an unsupervised Machine Learning pipeline to detect anomalies in Bitcoin transactions by selecting 19 key features from 700. Used PCA, t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, and K-Means/DBSCAN for clustering. Applied Hampel filter for noise correction and evaluated performance using Random Forest-derived silhouette scores.

## ðŸ“Š Pipeline Overview

### 1. ðŸ“‚ Data Preprocessing

- Transaction data is cleaned and normalized.
- **Hampel filter** is applied to remove extreme outliers and reduce noise.

### 2. ðŸ”» Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA** is used to reduce feature space while retaining variance.
- **t-SNE** helps in visualizing complex, high-dimensional patterns.

### 3. ðŸ“Œ Clustering for Pattern Discovery

- **K-Means Clustering** for identifying common behavior groups.
- **DBSCAN** for density-based anomaly detection and noise separation.
- **Silhouette Score** is used to evaluate cluster quality.

### 4. ðŸš¨ Outlier Detection

- **Isolation Forest** detects anomalous transactions by isolating rare patterns.

### 5. ðŸ“ˆ Feature Importance

- A **Random Forest** model ranks the most influential features post-clustering to help interpret anomaly causes (e.g., transaction value, frequency, mining difficulty, sentiment metrics).
